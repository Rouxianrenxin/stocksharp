1) get the Stock Model / Ticker namespace to be accessible outside the console
    a) make a [Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-model?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio-mac) with a Controller? Just to show the data from the default parameters? 
    
2) create the form that can change the parameters of the get info method
    b) figure out how to get a full list of ticker symbols into the dropdown at startup so we can make fetching easier for the user 
    
3) may very well need to go over the MVC structure of these apps again?
